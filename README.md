# Simple Hash Algorithm Example
### J37 Hash Algorithm

This repository contains a basic example of a hash algorithm implemented in Python language. Please note that this implementation is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used in any production or security-critical applications.

The main goal of this project is to provide a clear demonstration of how hash algorithms work and to highlight the concept of one-way algorithms. The code is intentionally simplified and lacks the necessary security measures and complexity required for real-world hash algorithms.

Also that code simulates the way that databases safely store and authenticate passwords when the user enter by simulating a simple Register and Sign-in Panel and apply the J37 Hash Algorithm to it     

Use this repository as a learning resource and starting point for understanding the principles of hash algorithms
